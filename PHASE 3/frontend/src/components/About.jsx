      <h1>About Airbnb</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2008, Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel and
        experience the world. As a global platform for hosting and booking
        accommodations, Airbnb connects millions of travelers with unique stays
        in over 220 countries. From cozy apartments in bustling cities to
        secluded cabins in tranquil forests, Airbnb offers an extensive range of
        lodging options that cater to every budget and preference.

        Beyond providing places to stay, Airbnb has fostered a sense of
        community and cultural exchange. By staying in homes rather than
        traditional hotels, travelers have the opportunity to immerse themselves
        in local cultures and connect with hosts who often share invaluable
        insights about their regions. This emphasis on personal connections has
        made Airbnb more than just a booking platform—it’s a way to create
        meaningful travel experiences.

        Today, Airbnb also offers "Experiences," curated activities hosted by
        locals. Whether it's a cooking class in Tuscany, a guided hike in the
        Himalayas, or an art workshop in Tokyo, these experiences allow
        travelers to discover hidden gems and engage with the world in a
        hands-on, authentic way.
